# VS Code Extension Downloader

A command-line tool to download VS Code extensions from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Background

This project was created to solve the issue of installing certain VS Code Marketplace extensions in Windsurf. The majority of the code was generated by Windsurf itself, with my involvement in requirements specification, architectural discussions, optimization suggestions, and validation work. 

The development process was remarkably efficient - within an hour, we had a fully functional, robust implementation with comprehensive features. The resulting code is stable, well-structured, and includes everything from platform-specific downloads to recursive dependency resolution. The speed and quality of the development process, powered by Windsurf's code generation capabilities, was truly remarkable.

## Features

- Automatically detects system platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Supports both ARM and x64 architectures
- Downloads platform-specific extension versions when available
- Shows download progress with a progress bar
- Optional recursive dependency downloading
- Avoids duplicate downloads
- Generates organized filenames with publisher, extension ID and version
- Robust download with automatic retry mechanism
- File integrity verification

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python vsix_downloader.py
```

The script will ask for:
1. A VS Code Marketplace URL
2. Whether to download dependencies

Example marketplace URLs:
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide

### Example Output

```
Enter VS Marketplace URL: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide
Download dependencies? (y/N): y
Detected platform: darwin-arm64

### Features

#### Platform Detection
Automatically detects your system platform and architecture to download the correct version:
- Windows: win32-x64, win32-arm64
- macOS: darwin-x64, darwin-arm64
- Linux: linux-x64, linux-arm64, linux-armhf

#### Dependency Resolution
When enabled, automatically:
- Reads the extension manifest
- Identifies required dependencies
- Downloads all dependencies recursively
- Prevents duplicate downloads

#### Organized Output
Downloaded files are stored in the `downloads` subdirectory with a consistent naming format:
```
{index}-{publisher}-{extension_id}-{version}.vsix
```
Example: 
- `01-ms-vscode-cpptools-1.24.1.vsix`
- `02-platformio-platformio-ide-3.3.4.vsix`

The numeric prefix indicates the installation order, ensuring dependencies are installed first.
